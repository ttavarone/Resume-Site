# Resume-Site
Project 1 in CSIS390 - Web Application Development:  A personal brand website, displaying my resume, coursework, interests, and past projects.

This site will be added to and updated with PHP, a database, and other backend/frontend elements.  The outcome is expected to be a website where one can generate their own page, with personal information.  This can be used as a personal portfolio and gives the user an easy way to share all their information and brand with potential employers.
